    <p>The movie "Veera Simha Reddy" features my all-time favorite song, 
        "Jai Balayya," which has definitely gained popularity among music lovers. 
        Thaman S's appealing song offers a captivating musical experience. 
        The background of a temple gives the images a cultural and artistic depth 
        that gives the song a special atmosphere. 
        The star's regal appearance and brisk gait are emphasized as noteworthy qualities 
        that accentuate Balayya's charisma and presence. 
        Renowned lyricist Ramajogayya Sastry and vocalist Karrimullah's partnership gives the 
        song an additional depth layer and guarantees a blend of meaningful lyrics and soulful vocals.
        Fans embracing the vibrant energy and diversity of culture that this song conveys</p>

    <p>"Aditya 369" has always been my favorite film because I enjoy the idea behind it. 
        A group of children use a time machine to investigate a robbery. 
        The protagonist couple, in their attempt to rescue the kids, 
        get stuck in the machine and travel all the way back to the period of the 
        ruler Krishnadevaraya (1500 A.D.) as well as into the future (2500 A.D.), 
        facing sticky situations along the way</p>

            <h4>Code of Snippet</h4>
            The function 'defer' accepts a function 'fn' along with an arbitrary number of additional arguments ('...args').Next, the input 'a' is used to schedule the execution of 'console.log('a')' using the 'defer' function. It also starts 'console.log('b')' right away.'console.log('b')' is run right away.
            'defer(console.log, 'a')' uses'setTimeout' to arrange the execution of 'console.log('a')'.
            <pre>
                const defer = (fn, ...args) => setTimeout(fn, 1, ...args);

                defer(console.log, 'a'), console.log('b'); // logs 'b' then 'a'
            </pre>
